<p>What better way to make the most of the gorgeous weather this summer than to celebrate with a BBQ? When the heat reaches tropical temperatures, it’s an invitation to get out the grill and invite your family and friends over and chow down on some <a href="https://www.musclefood.com/meat/bbq-meats.html">delicious BBQ food</a>. But to make sure you make the most of it, follow these simple tips.</p>

<h3 class="art-subtitle">Ensure the meat is cooked properly</h3>

<p>This may seem like an obvious one, but making sure the meat is properly cooked is so important for the sake of your health, as well as your guests. Food safety may not be at the fore front of your mind when having a good time in the sun, but research shows that food poisoning cases almost double over summer, so it’s important to stay vigilant. </p>

<p>Charred meat can be deceiving as it looks cooked on the outside, but this doesn’t mean it’s cooked properly on the inside. Turn the meat over at regular intervals to ensure it cooks evenly, a good way to test if meat is cooked properly is to stick a knife or skewer through it and if the juices run clear you know it’s ready to eat. If you’re still unsure, cook meat in the oven before hand to ensure it’s properly done, then finish it off on the BBQ for that distinctive smokey flavour.</p>

<h3 class="art-subtitle">Avoid cross contamination</h3>

<p>It’s really important when dealing with raw and cooked food that the two don’t ever come into contact with each other to avoid contamination, which can lead to food poisoning. Make sure you store raw meat separately and use different utensils such as chopping boards, knives and forks and BBQ tongs for raw and cooked food.</p>

<p>Avoid washing raw chicken before you cook it too, as the splash back can spread germs and harmful bugs onto your hands, clothes and surfaces.</p>

<h3 class="art-subtitle">Marinade your meat</h3>

<p>Investing in a good grade marinade, or making your own, will make a massive difference to the taste of your BBQ meat, such as a succulent steak</a>. A simple sauce made primarily of brown sugar, honey, salt and black pepper is all you need to bring out the mouth-watering flavours, just brush on with a pastry brush or leave to soak in a tray or bowl.</p>

<h3 class="art-subtitle">Get the temperature right</h3>

<p>Whether you like your burgers</a> low n slow for a seriously smokey flavour or your sausages</a> chargrilled to perfection, getting the heat just so ensures your meat is cooked thoroughly and there are no cremated causalities! Grilling over hot coals, as opposed to a direct flame will ensure the cooking is consistant as coals stay hot for a long time, ensuring your food is carefully charred rather than burnt to a cinder!</p>
