<p>Research suggests that most adults need between 25 and 35 grams of protein with each meal to keep their muscles strong and healthy.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to build strength in the gym, retain muscle mass and functionality as you get older, there’s no doubting that protein is important.</p>
<p>However, protein is the only fuel that powers your muscles. Here, we’ve picked out five other nutrients which can improve your muscle and body health.</p>
<h2 class="art-subtitle">1. Calcium</h2>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://d3rxe6nylop6k3.cloudfront.net/catalog/product/cache/1/image/530x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/h/shaken_udder_2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="ShakenUdderMilkshakes"></figure>
<p>Calcium has long been known for building strong bones, but it can be equally important for building strong muscles.</p>
<p>Calcium regulation is a key part of muscle contraction and, as a result, the building of muscle. A release of calcium into your muscles kick-starts every contraction they make, whether that’s lifting weights, hitting the treadmill or even typing away at your computer.</p>
<p>Most adults need between 1000 and 1300 milligrams of calcium per day, so a 250ml glass of milk will help you reach approximately a quarter of that amount.</p>
<p>Shaken Udder milkshakes are a great source of calcium.</p>
<p>Made with no artificial colours or ingredients, they offer creamy milkshake goodness without nasty additives. Each 300ml serving provides 396mg of calcium, 11.8g of protein plus Vitamin B12 to contribute to the normal function of the immune system.</p>
<h2 class="art-subtitle">2. Vitamin D</h2>
<p>Vitamin D offers many similar benefits as calcium. It promotes good bone health but may also help to keep your muscles in decent shape.</p>
<p>One study, for example, concluded that vitamin D deficiency, which can be very common amongst both children and adults, is linked to poor muscle health and function.</p>
<p>Whatever your age, look to boost your vitamin D intake to healthier levels by soaking up sunshine (while wearing sunblock, of course) but also from egg yolks, mushrooms, fatty fish and fortified dairy products.</p>
<h2 class="art-subtitle">3. Zinc</h2>
<p>Zinc works to boost the immune system, keep workouts strong and help muscles repair from exercise.</p>
<p>Zinc also aids in muscle protein synthesis, which is the process by which the protein you eat becomes part of your muscles.</p>
<p>Red meat and poultry are the main sources of zinc for most people, but interestingly oysters are the single-richest source available. A single serving provides five times your daily recommended intake.</p>
<p>Vegetarian options include beans and peas.</p>
<h2 class="art-subtitle">4. HMB</h2>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/musclefooduk/images/articles/20503-Article-Saturday-13th-August/20503-Article-Images5.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="SupplementShake&quot;"></figure>
<p>HMB – otherwise known as beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate – floats through your bloodstream in small amounts after your body breaks down leucine, an amino acid found in some protein sources including eggs, meat and fish.</p>
<p>Studies have also shown that HMB can slow the breakdown of muscle and help to maintain muscle mass, particularly in older adults who may be less active than their younger counterparts.</p>
<p>Most sides on HMB and muscle health involve taking one gram doses three times a day, the equivalent of eating roughly 600 grams of protein or 60 grams of leucine per day.</p>
<p>This, of course, is impossible to achieve through whole foods, so HMB supplements would be the way to go here.</p>
<p>Since the supplement doesn’t last long in the body smaller, more spread out doses are more effective. It’s worth doing your research on supplements before taking them, though.</p>
<h2 class="art-subtitle">5. Creatine</h2>
<p>Creatine might be associated with bodybuilders but has every reason to be popular amongst everyday health-conscious people too.</p>
<p>This natural compound helps you to take every workout to the next level, particularly if you like high-intensity exercise.</p>
<p>Creatine does not directly produce bigger muscles, but it helps muscles train to a higher intensity. With creatine, muscles may be able to increase in size due to the increase in harder, more intense training.</p>
<p>You can obtain creatine from meat, but a balanced diet usually only provides one gram of it, while a scoop of creatine powder provides roughly three to five grams.</p>
<p>You should talk to your GP or doctor before beginning any supplements, of course, but research suggests that creatine supplementation can be beneficial to the body.</p>
