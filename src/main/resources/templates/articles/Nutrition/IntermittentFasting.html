<p>One method which has become increasingly popular in recent years is intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>This is a way of eating which involves regular short-term fasts. Fasting for short periods helps people to eat fewer calories and also help to optimise certain hormones related to weight control.</p>
<p>However, is it a good way to bust the excess fat? This article aims to find out.</p>
<h2 class="art-subtitle">Eating fewer calories</h2>
<p>The main reason that people are finding intermittent fasting an effective route to weight loss is that it helps them to eat fewer calories.</p>
<p>All the different techniques to this dieting method involve skipping meals during the fasting process. Unless you compensate by eating a lot more during the eating periods, you will be consuming fewer calories.</p>
<p>According to a study in 2014</a>, intermittent fasting can lead to significant weight loss. In this research, intermittent fasting was discovered to reduce body weight by up to 3-8% over a period of three to 24 weeks.</p>
<p>When this weight loss was examined further, people lost on average 0.55 pounds per week with intermittent fasting, but 1.65 pounds per week with alternate-day fasting.</p>
<p>People also lost 4-7% of their waist circumference, suggesting that they lost belly fat as a result.</p>
<p>Calorie counting is not generally needed when doing intermittent fasting, although the weight loss is mostly generated by an overall reduction in calorie intake.</p>
<h2 class="art-subtitle">Holding on to muscle</h2>
<p>A common side effect of dieting is the body’s tendency to burn muscle in addition to fat.</p>
<p>This can lead to a loss of muscle and definition in people.</p>
<p>There are studies, though, which suggest that intermittent fasting might be beneficial for holding on to muscle whilst losing belly fat.</p>
<p>One study</a> discovered that intermittent calorie restriction caused a similar amount of weight loss as continuous calorie restriction, but with a much smaller reduction in muscle mass.</p>
<p>In calorie restriction studies, 25% of the weight lost was muscle mass, compared to just 10% in the intermittent calorie restriction studies.</p>
<p>Another study had its participants eat the same amount of calories as they had previously, but in one very large meal in the evening. They all lost body fat and increased their muscle mass, along with seeing a number of positive health changes.</p>
<h2 class="art-subtitle">Making healthy eating easier</h2>
<p>One of the main benefits of intermittent fasting is its simplicity.</p>
<p>Instead of eating three or more meals through the day, you can eat fewer meals which makes it much easier and simpler to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>The best diets are ones which you can stick to.</p>
<p>If intermittent fasting makes it easier for you to stick to a healthy diet, then this will have long-term benefits for your health and weight maintenance.</p>
<h2 class="art-subtitle">How it affects hormones</h2>
<p>Body fat is your body’s way of storing energy, or calories. When we don’t eat anything, the body changes a number of things to make the stored energy more accessible.</p>
<p>This is associated with changes in nervous system activity along with a major change in a number of crucial hormones.</p>
<p>When you fast, changes in your metabolism include a decrease in insulin, which normally increases when we eat. Lower levels of insulin facilitate fat burning.</p>
<p>The levels of human growth hormone may increase during a fast, almost five times as much. Growth hormone is a hormone that can aid fat loss and muscle gain, among other things.</p>
<p>The nervous system also sends norepinephrine to the fat cells, making them break down body fat into free fatty acids which can be burned for energy.</p>
<p>Studies have also shown that fasting for about 48 hours boosts metabolism but fasting periods which are longer can have the opposite effect.</p>
<h2 class="art-subtitle">Key points to take into account</h2>
<p>There are a number of important aspects you should keep in mind if you want to lose weight with intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>The quality of your food is perhaps the most key. Try to eat mainly whole and single ingredient foods, rather than processed or packaged goods.</p>
<p>Calories still count. Try to eat as normally as possible during your non-fasting periods, but not so much that you make up for the calories you missed out on by fasting.</p>
<p>You need staying power with this method. As with any weight loss programme, consistency is vital; you need to stick with it for an extended period of time if you want to see results.</p>
<p>Patience is also important. It can take your body time to adjust to an intermittent fasting method. Aim to be consistent with your meal plans and it will become easier with time.</p>
<p>Strength training is also worth considering. Many of the popular intermittent fasting programs suggest it as an important accompaniment as this will help you burn mostly body fat while holding on to muscle.</p>

<h2 class="art-subtitle">Methods of intermittent fasting</h2>
<p>There are a variety of different ways of intermittent fasting, here are three of the most popular.</p>
<p><strong><strong>•The 16/8 method</strong></strong> sees you skip breakfast every day and eat during an eight-hour feeding window, for example between 12 noon and 8pm.</p>
<p><strong><strong>•The 5:2 Diet</strong></strong> requires you to only eat 500-600 calories on two days of the week but eat normally for the other five days.</p>
<p><strong><strong>•Eat-Stop-Eat</strong></strong> is where you do one or two 24-hour fasts each week, for example not eating from dinner one day until dinner the next.</p>
<p>Provided you don’t overeat during the non-fasting periods, these methods will help to promote a reduced calorie intake and help you to lose weight.</p>
<h2 class="art-subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Intermittent fasting has been found to be a useful way of losing weight.</p>
<p>The reduction in calories along with beneficial hormone effects play their part in busting belly fat and improving your general wellbeing.</p>
<p>It might not be for everyone, but it is a method to consider if you feel it can work for you.</p>
