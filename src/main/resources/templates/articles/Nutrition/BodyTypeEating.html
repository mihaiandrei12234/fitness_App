<p>Everyone’s body stores fat differently from other bodies, with different shapes and forms. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to weight loss, dieting or general nutrition, so you need to understand your body type.</p><p>When you start to understand your body type, you’ll be able to tailor your eating habits to suit.</p><p>Here, we take a look at the different types of body and whether body type is eating is an approach worth taking.</p>
<h2 class="art-subtitle">What is eating for your body type?</h2>
<p>Many people believe that body type just describes the way a person looks. However, your body type can also provide important information about how you respond to foods you eat, and about your hormonal and nervous system characteristics.</p>
<p>Physique characteristics can also be linked to metabolic differences between individuals. Once a person has identified their body type, the can adjust their nutrient intake accordingly to make the most of their body composition and achieve their health related goals.</p>
<p>There are three categories of body types – ectomorph, mesomorph and endomorph.</p>
<h2 class="art-subtitle">What are the body types?</h2>

<p><strong><strong>Ectomorphs</strong></strong> are thin individuals characterised by smaller bone structures and thinner limbs. Think of an endurance athlete and you’re in that territory. They are usually thyroid and SNS dominant with a higher output or sensitivity to catecholamines like epinephrine and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>This profile is linked to a fast metabolic rate and high carbohydrate tolerance.</p>
<p>This group generally works best with more carbohydrates in their diet, along with a moderate protein and lower fat intake.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Mesomorphs </strong></strong>have a medium sized bone structure and athletic body, with a considerable amount of lean mass if they’re active.</p>
<p>Many explosive athletes such as wrestlers, gymnasts and tennis players fall under these criteria.</p>
<p>Mesomorphs are typically testosterone and growth hormone dominant. This profiles leads to a predisposition for muscle gain and the maintenance of a lower body fat.</p>
<p>Mesomorphs do best on a mixed diet, which consists of balanced carbohydrates, proteins and fats. A macronutrient split of 40% carbohydrate, 30% protein and 30% fat generally works well.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Endomorphs </strong></strong>have a larger bone structure with higher amounts of total body mass and fat mass. Powerlifters are good examples of endomorphs; they tend to be less active.</p>
<p>Where ectomorphs tend to burn off excess calories with almost constant movement, excess calories in endomorphs do not to seem to cause that same increase in expenditure, which means excess calories are more likely to be stored as fat.</p>
<p>This body profile leads to a greater chance for energy storage including both lean mass and fat mass. This can also mean a lower carbohydrate tolerance.</p>
<p>Endomorphs typically do better on a higher fat and protein intake with carbohydrate intake being correctly controlled and properly timed, for example after exercise. More fat and protein and fewer carbohydrates is the way to go here.</p>
<p>A macronutrient split of 25% carbs, 35% protein and 40% fat is a good breakdown.</p>
<h2 class="art-subtitle">Recommendations</h2>
<h3 class="art-subtitle"><strong><strong>Ectomorph</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Ectomorphs have a high carbohydrate tolerance and they should include plenty of carb-dense foods around exercise.</p>
<p>Some starchy, whole grain, minimally processed carbohydrates should also be eaten at other meals. Vegetables and/or fruits (in a 3:1 serving ratio) should be eaten at each meal.</p>
<h3 class="art-subtitle"><strong><strong>Mesomorph</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Mesomorphs have a moderate carbohydrate tolerance and should be including carb-dense foods around exercise.</p>
<p>Some starchy, whole grain, minimally processed carbohydrates may also be eaten at other meals, but should be consumed in moderation. Vegetables and/or fruits (in a 4:1 serving ratio) should be eaten at each meal.</p>
<h3 class="art-subtitle"><strong><strong>Endomorph</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Endomorphs should eat all their carb-dense foods around exercise.</p>
<p>Vegetables and/or fruits should be eaten (in a 5:1 serving ratio) at each meal.</p>
<h2 class="art-subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In general, it is best to experiment with different nutritional strategies until you find something which works for you.</p>
<p>However, if lengthy trial and error with food does not sound appealing, identifying your body type and eating the appropriate distribution of nutrients might be the smartest place to begin.</p>
<p>Whatever your body type, body composition or overall health status, your ability to handle carbohydrate-dense foods is improved significantly the more active you are.</p>
<p>The guidelines we’ve mentioned above are great for muscle gain – provided overall food intake is high enough – maintenance and even moderate weight loss and shifting of body composition.</p>
<p>For people who are new to healthy eating, you shouldn’t be concerned too much by body type eating.</p>
<p>Body type eating is an effective way to provide yourself with the correct balance of foods required to fuel, maintain and improve your body and wellbeing.</p>
