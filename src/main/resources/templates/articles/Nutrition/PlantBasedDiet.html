<p>Vegan foods are more popular than ever and, with Veganuary becoming increasingly popular every year, more are becoming aware of a vegan diet as a solid option to follow in the long term.</p>
<p>There are a number of benefits of switching to purely plant-based food, including a number of health boosting elements, the improved welfare of animals and, according to some, significant weight loss.</p>
<p>How exactly is this weight loss possible? The science behind it is not 100% clear yet but there is good evidence to suggest that going to a plant-based diet leads to a reduction in the number of high calorie foods you consume. </p>
<p>Here, we look at if a plant based diet is good for weight loss.</p>
<p><strong>The nutrients</strong></p>
<p>If you switch to a vegan diet from a regular diet, you’ll be cutting out meat and animal products.</p>
<p>This will lead you to becoming more reliant on other foods. In the form of a vegan diet, this will include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes and seeds.</p>
<p>Vegan diets tend to provide more fibre, antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds. They are also rich in potassium, magnesium and a number of vitamins including A, C and E.</p>
<p><strong>Why go plant based?</strong></p>
<p>Transitioning to a plant based diet has its positives for many reasons beyond weight loss. Research has suggested that you’ll improve your health, reduce your risk of common chronic diseases including heart disease and diabetes, along with some cancers.</p>
<p>You’ll also be helping the planet and reduce harm to animals.</p>
<p>The key with any diet is to focus on long term lifestyle changes which are realistic and sustainable.</p>
<p>Switching to a diet that is rich in fruit, vegetables, lentils, beans and nuts is not just a fad, it’s a lifestyle change that you can remain with, just as much as any healthy eating plan is.</p>
<p><strong>Does a plant based diet work?</strong></p>
<p>Sustained weight loss is beneficial for health for those who can achieve it, as short-term diets are more likely to fail. </p>
<p>Changing to a plant based diet is one strategy to lose the pounds. Studies have suggested that people who eat such a diet generally have lower BMIs (body mass indexes) than those who eat meat.</p>
<p><strong>A study</strong> of 38000 people in the UK discovered that vegan’s BMIs averaged roughly 22 kg/m2, which was lower than meat eaters, who had an average BMI of about 24kg/m2.</p>
<p>Others, though, may have trouble with yo-yo dieting when going onto a plant based plan.</p>
<p>This is when you go through cycles of losing weight then regaining all or more of that weight, possibly due to have trouble sticking to plant based only foods. This kind of dieting has been linked with some serious health consequences including heart disease and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Regardless of these and other potential drawbacks, eating purely plant based foods and lose weight. The important thing – as with all diets – is focusing on nutrient-dense foods instead of empty calories. </p>
<p>This means looking towards more fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, seeds and nuts, while avoiding unnecessary fats, sugars, starches and food additives. </p>
<p><strong>Is this approach good for you?</strong></p>
<p>Cutting out some of the main food groups in your diet may seem unhealthy, even if you are trying to lose weight. Unless you pay close attention to your nutrient intake, it can have its drawbacks.</p>
<p>For example, there are concerns over getting enough protein and other essential nutrients such as vitamin B12. This is found naturally only in animal products and a deficiency in it can result in anaemia.</p>
<p>To avoid vitamin and mineral deficiencies you should look to eat more vitamin-fortified cereals and fortified soy products.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>A plant based diet may provide an array of health benefits, from a reduction in heart disease, type 2 diabetes and even improved joint health.</p>
<p>There are suggestions that the fibre found in fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds will help you to maintain a healthy body weight, thanks to its way of increasing saiety after meals, meaning you’re more likely to eat less.</p>
<p>The key to making a plant based diet plan work is to balance plant based meals with good sources of plant protein, along with complex carbohydrates and fat, to give yourself a more rounded range of key nutrients and minerals your body needs.</p>
<p>Before you make any big changes to your diet you should talk to your doctor or dietitian and discuss how you’ll get important nutrients such as proteins and B vitamins into your eating plan.</p>
