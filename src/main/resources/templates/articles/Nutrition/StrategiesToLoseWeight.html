<h3 class="art-subtitle">Prep Meals in Advance</h3>
<p>It's been a hard day at work. You're on your way back home when it hits you: you have nothing at home for dinner. Due to affordability and ease of access, you choose to stop off at your local fast food drive-thru.</p>
<p>Sure, fast food is quick and easy to obtain. But it's also horrible for you and can sabotage your goals.</p>
<p>Ditch the fast food and instead spend one day per week prepping your week's meals in advance. Though meal prepping might seem like a lot of work upfront, it's more than worth it.</p>

<p>For starters, it allows you to take control of portion sizes so you can ensure a calorie deficit for the day. It's also far more affordable than eating out all the time, especially if you <a href="https://www.musclefood.com/clearance/viewall-clearance.html">shop for deals</a>. For additional savings, be on the lookout for <a href="https://www.musclefood.com/bundles.html">hamper deals</a>, which bundle more ingredients for less money.</p>
<p>Just cook, store, and reheat. Meal prepping is a low-stress and low-calorie solution that puts you back in charge of your meals.</p>
<h3 class="art-subtitle">Focus on Protein-Rich Meals</h3>
<p>Meal prepping alone is a great way to start losing weight on a budget. But if you're eating the wrong things, you could still wind up hungry or nutritionally deficient.</p>
<p>To give your body the energy it needs throughout the day, make sure your prepped meals are balanced, starting with a heaping helping of protein.</p>
<p>If you eat meat, stock up on chicken. A single chicken breast from a <a href="https://www.musclefood.com/premium-chicken-breast-fillets-2-5kg.html">2.5kg package</a> or a <a href="https://www.musclefood.com/chicken-breast-fillets-bulk.html">5kg package</a> contains 44g of protein per serving. Lean mince is another affordable option for meat-eaters, running about Â£3.50 per 0.4kg package.</p>
<p>For vegetarians, add flaxseed to salads or spruce up your favourite dishes with mock chicken or steak.</p>

<h3 class="art-subtitle">Look for Free Ways to Exercise</h3>
<p>80% of weight loss</a> will come from your diet. That leaves 20% up to exercise, so it's time to get out and start burning those calories!</p>
<p>Gym memberships can be expensive, though, so instead, look for things you can do around the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>A 30-minute jog at a light pace can burn well over 100 calories. You can also go for a hike, invest in a small set of free weights at home, or try shadowboxing.</p>
<p>As long as it gets your heart rate up, you can expect to burn fat.</p>
